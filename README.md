Introduction
A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that allows you to add elements to the top and remove elements from the top. This implementation uses an array with a fixed size to manage the stack elements.

Features
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element without removing it from the stack.
Display: Displays all the elements in the stack.
Usage
To use this custom stack, simply instantiate an object of the MyStack class with the desired size of the stack, and then use the available methods (push, pop, peek, display) to interact with the stack.

Methods
push(int element): Adds an element to the stack.
pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
peek(): Returns the top element without removing it.
display(): Displays all elements in the stack.
