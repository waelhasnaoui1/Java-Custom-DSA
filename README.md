Custom Stack in Java
This repository contains a custom stack implementation in Java. The stack is implemented using a fixed-size array and follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. This simple data structure supports basic operations such as push, pop, peek, and display.

Features
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element without removing it from the stack.
Display: Displays all the elements in the stack.

Methods
push(int element): Adds an element to the stack.
pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
peek(): Returns the top element without removing it.
display(): Displays all elements in the stack.
